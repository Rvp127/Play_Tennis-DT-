# Play_Tennis-DT-
1. This Code is for understanding the usage of DecisionTree algorithm on a Dataset which has 4 features(or columns) i.e. Outlook, Temperature, Humidity &amp; Wind related to decision column(or feature) called Playtennis.
2. This code mainly demonstrates how these features make the decision to play tennis. The output from the code delivered will give a basic understanding on how desicion tree works under the 2 main criteria's which are 'Entropy' and 'Gini Index'. 
3. *Note* The Last criteria 'Gini' index is created as a 'dot' file and can be exported to visual studio code. This file is created by the code itself but you can always verify it by downloading it from the above. 


Please refer the Project report for proper methodology and steps.
Thank You!
