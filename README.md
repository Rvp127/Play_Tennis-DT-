# Play_Tennis-DT-
This Code is for understanding the usage of DecisionTree algorithm on a Dataset which has 4 features(or columns) i.e. Outlook, Temperature, Humidity &amp; Wind related to decision column(or feature) called Playtennis. This code mainly demonstrates how these features make the decision to play tennis. The output from the code delivered will give a basic understanding on how desicion tree works under the 2 main criteria's which are 'Entropy' and 'Gini Index'. 
*Note* The Last criteria 'Gini' index is created as a 'dot' file and can be exported to visual studio code. 
Please refer the Project report for proper methodology and steps.
Thank You!
